## About Project
The GPA & CGPA Calculator is a Streamlit-based application designed to help students calculate their GPA for each semester and CGPA over the entire course duration. The application allows users to input marks and credits for each subject across multiple semesters, computes GPA for each semester, and calculates CGPA based on the total credits and grades. Additionally, the project offers options to download the GPA/CGPA data in PDF and Excel formats for further reference.
